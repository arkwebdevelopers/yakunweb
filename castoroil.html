						<p> Castor oil is a vegetable oil obtained by pressing the seeds of the Castor plant “Ricinus communis” The common name "castor oil" probably comes from its use as a replacement for castoreum, a perfume base made from the dried perineal glands of the beaver “castor in Latin” Castor oil and its derivatives are used in the manufacturing of soaps, lubricants, hydraulic and brake fluids, paints, dyes, coatings, inks, cold resistant plastics, waxes and polishes, nylon, pharmaceuticals and perfumes.  </p>

                    <li>
                        <p> Castor oil is a colorless to very pale yellow liquid with mild or no odor or taste. Its boiling point is 313 °C 595 °F and its density is 961 kg/m3. It is a triglyceride in which approximately 90 percent of fatty acid chains are ricinoleate. Oleate and linoleates are the other significant components. </p>

                    <li>
                        <p> Vegetable oils, due to their good lubricity and biodegradability are attractive alternatives to petroleum-derived lubricants, but oxidative stability and low temperature performance limit their widespread use. Castor oil has better low temperature viscosity properties and high temperature lubrication than most vegetable oils, making it useful as a lubricant in jet, diesel, and race car engines.  </p>
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                        <p> Castor oil is the raw material for the production of a number of chemicals, notably sebacic acid, undecylenic acid, and nylon-11. A review listing numerous chemicals derived from castor oil is available. The production of lithium grease consumes a significant amount of castor oil. Hydrogenation and saponification of castor oil yields 12-hydroxystearic acid which is then reacted with lithium hydroxide or lithium carbonate to give high performance lubricant grease.  </p>

                    <li>
                        <p> Castor Oil has many skin benefits it keeps the skin healthy and young looking through its seemingly endless medicinal actions. It is not a surprise then Castor Oil is also used for the prevention, treatment and healing of acne as well as minimizing acne scars. The use of this oil from castor beans has been widely used throughout centuries and is a truly safe and cheap means of ensuring acne. </p>
